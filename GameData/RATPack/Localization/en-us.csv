"LOC_RAT_81","RAT-1 ""Pinwheel"" Ram Air Turbine"
"LOC_RAT_82","A basic Ram Air Turbine that will generate power from airflow. This basic unit must be activated manually. Cheap and light they are often used to generate power for SRBs and engines that don't have an alternator."
"LOC_RAT_83","RAT-6000 ""Pack Master"" Ram Air Turbine"
"LOC_RAT_84","A highly advanced Ram Air Turbine. Supposedly created after one of the engineers was introduced to oragami, it folds up to conserve space. It deploys automatically when when a power loss is detected. It contains an internal battery that automatically enables to provide power while it deploys, ensuring near continous power."
"LOC_RAT_85","RAT-360 ""Cage Master"" Ram Air Turbine"
"LOC_RAT_86","A Ram Air Turbine with the ability to auto-activate when power is lost. Providing more power than earlier models you can almost power a coffee maker or SAS (sold separately). Built inside of an aerodynamic shell it takes a few seconds to deploy and provide power. Due to the aerodynamic shell it requires higher speeds and/or pressures to generate power, but isn't subject to power drop off above mach 1."
"LOC_RAT_87","RAT-720 ""Topper"" Ram Air Turbine"
"LOC_RAT_88","Designed to go on top of a rocket instead of radially, this Ram Air Turbine is popular for aerial probes. Peak power is much higher than previous models due to its larger size."
"LOC_RAT_89","TAWS-1 ""Lookout"" Warning System"
"LOC_RAT_90","Provides advance warning before you hit the ground."

"LOC_RAT_93","TR-1 ""Backup"" Thrust Reverser"
"LOC_RAT_94","SatNet Aerospace"
"LOC_RAT_95","Redirects thrust in the opposite direction. We've been assured that the exhaust fumes directed back towards the cabin are mostly harmless... as long as you're wearing a sealed space suit."
"LOC_RAT_96","TR-L ""Way Back"" Thrust Reverser"
"LOC_RAT_97","This thrust reverser can redirect thrust of longer engines with ease. The manufacturer has reminded us (mostly Jeb) not to fly in reverse."
